Bamazon Database app:
to use this database app, the customer can see the products, price, and quantities available to order. 

The through nodeJS, the app asks the customer what product they would like to order and how many. If there is a sufficient quantity, the app takes the order and returns the price to the customer. If there is not sufficient quantity, the app tells the custmer to try again. Once the product is ordered,the database quantities are updated.

For the manager app, the manager has a list of options to choose from- they can see the entire inventory of the database, the low inventory, they can add stock quantities to an existing product, and they can add a new product.
